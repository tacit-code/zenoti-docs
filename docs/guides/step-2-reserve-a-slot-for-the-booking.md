You can also change the appointment time slot duration as per your requirement. For example, if the Appointment Time Slot is configured at 5 mins, you will see the time slots in the Appointment Book as 10:00, 10:05, 10:10, and so on. The difference between each time slot will be 5 mins. Similarly, if the setting is configured at 15 mins, you will see the times slots in the Appointment Book as 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, and so on.
