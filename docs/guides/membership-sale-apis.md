### What are memberships in Zenoti?

### API workflow

Memberships are a way to generate new business and retain customers. A well-designed membership program generates a continuous revenue stream for your center while giving customers value for money through benefits and discounts.

The data generated from membership programs allow you to understand your customer demographics and preferences. In turn, this helps you focus on services and products that maximize your revenues and to identify where you are losing money.

You can design your memberships in various ways. For instance, you might offer a membership that gives the guest one free 60-minute massage every month. To sweeten the deal, you can let members carry over unused services to the following month or allow them to exchange the free service for another service.

- Recurring memberships: This type of membership is one where the guests sign up for a plan in which they pay at regular intervals. For instance, they might pay a monthly amount for which they might get a certain number of credits or services. The advantage of this sort of membership is that it gives the guest the flexibility to stop, pause, or continue the service at any time. Recurring memberships form an important part of the monthly revenue for the business.
- Non-recurring memberships: This type of membership is limited to a specified duration and the payment is collected in one go. Here too the guests receive credits or services but once they are consumed, the membership automatically expires. Unlike recurring memberships, which require you to pay monthly, you can purchase a non-recurring membership for a period of 3, 6, or 12 months, with a one-time payment.

- Membership: Ensure you've created either a recurring or a non-recurring membership for your business.
- Set the payment criteria: Ensure that the payment criteria for the memberships are configured. Especially for the recurring memberships.
- Discounts: You must set up service and product discounts as required for each membership that you create.
- Member Pricing: You must set up a discounted price for services to your members.

- Select a membership
- Generate an invoice
- Collect payment for the invoice
- Close the invoice and send a confirmation email to the guest
