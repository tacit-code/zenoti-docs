Gift cards are a popular way of gifting that allows the intended recipients to purchase a product, or a service of their choice using the cash value on the card. Guests can also buy predefined gift cards that have a value or a set of services pre-configured in them.

You can sell three types of gift cards in Zenoti:

Gift cards can be sold with the same price and value or with different prices and values.

This collection of APIs provides an interface from which you can search for a guest, create a gift card template, and sell a gift card to the guest.

You can sell a gift card to a guest by using any one of these two methods:

Method 1: Sell a gift card and generate an invoice without using a gift card template
Method 2: Sell a gift card and generate an invoice by using a gift card template

For Method 2, take the following steps:

- Amount gift cards: Amount gift cards are sold for a specific price.
For example, if a guest purchases an amount gift card for $100, the recipient can later redeem the amount gift card for any item worth $100.
If the gift card amount is lower than the total invoice amount, then the recipient pays the difference using other payment methods (cash/card/check).
- Service gift cards: Service/Day Package gift cards are sold for specific services or day packages against a specific amount.
For instance, if a guest wants to gift a Sports Deep Tissue Massage to someone, they could buy a Sports Tissue Massage gift card for the same price at which that service is offered in your center. So, if the price of the Sports Tissue Massage is $100, the guest pays $100 for the gift card.
- Predefined gift cards: You can set up predefined gift cards - that is, predefined with a set of services or of a predefined value. As an administrator, you can also assign a name to such predefined gift cards so that the front-desk staff can easily identify and sell such cards.
For example, you may configure a predefined service-based gift card called ‘Rejuvenate Gift Card’ with two Basic Manicures, two Basic Pedicures, and one Fruit Facial. Similarly, predefined amount-based gift cards with values such as $50 or $100 may be named ‘Snappy 50’ and ‘Cool Hundred’ respectively.
