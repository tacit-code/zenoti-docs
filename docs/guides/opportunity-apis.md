### API workflow

An opportunity or a sales opportunity is essentially a sales lead that represents a potential customer who could potentially purchase a service or a product from you. You can use opportunities to sell memberships, packages, products, or services.

You can create an opportunity for any guest or caller who expresses interest in purchasing a membership, package, product, or service but has not yet made the actual purchase. Zenoti makes it easy for you to create opportunities or sales leads when a membership or package is due to expire. An opportunity is, therefore, a potential sale to a new or existing customer that you have not yet closed.
