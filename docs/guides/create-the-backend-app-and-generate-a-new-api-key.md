API stands for Application Programming Interface, which allows your application to talk to Zenoti applications. As a business, you can use APIs to:

Basics
For APIs, an endpoint acts as a touchpoint of communication. An endpoint contains a URL of a server or service from which APIs can access the resources they need.
The request method (verb) identifies the action you want to perform. To fetch something from Zenoti, use the GET method. Similarly, to save or update something to Zenoti, make the request using the POST method. To delete data such as access tokens or employee profiles, use the DELETE method.
Zenoti accepts form-encoded or JSON-encoded response bodies. Each request has a response in JSON format. For more information, refer to response and error code

Zenoti APIs
With Zenoti API, you can access the data stored in your Zenoti account using code. After you have access to Zenoti APIs, you can build an app as per your use case. Zenoti APIs use REST APIs that follow the REST architectural style to interact with RESTful web services.
To communicate with Zenoti APIs, you first need to create a backend app in Zenoti. Set permissions on the app, based on who can access and use the app.
