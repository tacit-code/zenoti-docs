If you require any help related to accessing the Zenoti API, reach out to us at apisupport@zenoti.com.

If you receive a 503 response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes. If the outage persists or if you receive any other form of 5XX error, do let us know.
